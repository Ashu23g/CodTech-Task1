Project Overview: Password Strength Checker

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a Python script that evaluates the strength of a user's password based on several criteria. It provides feedback on whether the password is strong or weak and suggests areas for improvement if it doesn't meet certain standards.

Features:
1. Password Length Validation: 
   - The password must be at least 8 characters long. This is a basic requirement to avoid overly short and vulnerable passwords.

2. Character Variety Checks:
   - The password should contain at least one lowercase letter (`[a-z]`).
   - The password should contain at least one uppercase letter (`[A-Z]`).
   - The password should include at least one digit (`[0-9]`).
   - The password should include at least one special character from a predefined set (`@#$%^&+=!`).

3. Feedback to User:
   - If the password does not meet any of the above criteria, specific feedback is given, indicating which aspect is missing (e.g., "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter").
   - If the password meets all the criteria, the feedback is positive, indicating that the password is strong.

Workflow:

1. User Input:
   - The user is prompted to enter a password via the command line.
   
2. Validation Process:
   - The inputted password is passed through a series of checks using regular expressions.
   - These checks ensure that the password satisfies each of the defined criteria.

3. Result Output:
   - Based on the evaluation, the program prints feedback that informs the user whether the password is strong or weak.
   - If weak, the feedback specifies what criteria the password failed to meet.

Implementation Details:
- Language: Python
- Libraries: The project utilizes the `re` (Regular Expressions) library for pattern matching.
- Key Functions: 
  - `re.search()` is used to match specific patterns within the password.
  - `len()` is used to check the length of the password.
  
Use Cases:
- End User: This tool helps users create strong passwords that improve their security online.
- Developers: It serves as a simple example of input validation, regular expression usage, and user interaction in Python.

Future Enhancements:
1. **Password Strength Grading**: Expand from "Weak" and "Strong" classifications to a more granular grading system like "Very Weak", "Moderate", "Very Strong".
2. **GUI Integration**: Convert the command-line interface to a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries such as `tkinter` or `PyQt`.
3. **Password Suggestions**: Provide suggestions for stronger passwords if the user inputs a weak password.
4. **Internationalization**: Support for various languages and keyboard layouts, ensuring the password checker works globally.
